What it Does
=============

This program calculates and visualizes the gration tensors of a protein (based on geometry) for each chain. 

Best Practices
==============

1. Uniquely name each chain in the PDB file
2. This program is currently only calculates one model. Gyration tensor for analyzing trajectory is in development.

Installation Instructions (Linux)
=================================

1. Please check the following requirements are installed for your python version

  Tkinter
  numpy
	
2. Download gyration tensor plugin from the git repo 
	git clone git://github.com/VenkyKrishnamani/gyration_tensor.git
3. cd gyration_tensor
4. Run 'pymol' with administrator priviledges
5. Navigate to plugins > install
6. Choose gyration_tensor.py from the dialogbox and 'OK'
7. Quit and Restart 'pymol' (now it is not required to be administator mode)
